								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-laptop-code"></span>
									<h3>I have more than 3 years of professional experience in interactive applications and game development</h3>
									<p>Most of this experience have been working in start-up companies, which I believe has made me very adaptable to change and has taught me a lot of different topics that I wouldn't have learned.</p>

								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>...but I have been using these tools in one way for another for much longer</h3>

									<h3>My main technical skill is writing C# code within the Unity engine</h3>
									<p>I have worked with many, many parts of the engine along the years. In terms of other technologies, I have also used Unreal Engine. I am proficient writing in other languages as well, mainly C++ and Python.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
